# tokentool
Web app for creating battle map tokens. This proejcted started as a web based re-write of this tool: http://www.rptools.net/toolbox/token-tool/. The RPTools utility is very good, but crashes on macOS, and I would like to explore adding some additional useful features.

## TODO
* Add menu with controls for:
  * ~Visualizing output token with transparency~
  * ~Picking output size~
  * ~Picking border~
  * ~Adjusting border~
  * ~Scaling token image~
  * ~Setting background~
* Need to be able to load images
  * ~From disk~
  * ~From URL~
  * From clipboard?
* ~Be able to download final token~
* Allow users to load their own frames
* Possible other features:
  * ~Have some base frames and a color picker to adjust them~
    * Auto-calculate frame color based on token image average value?
  * Procedural generation of frames
